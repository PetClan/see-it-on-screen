            See It Off Productions Limited and See It On Screen (hereinafter referred to as "SIOP", "we", "our" and
            "us") respects the privacy of SIOP website visitors and other people we communicate electronically with,
            including via email (hereinafter referred to as "you" and "your"). This notice sets out information about
            our collection and processing of personal information related to you as an individual visiting our website
            or communicating with us electronically. We act as a "controller" for the purposes of data protection law.
        </p>

        <p>
            Our website may contain links to other websites. Please note that we have no control over how your personal
            information is collected, stored, or used by other websites and we advise you to check the privacy policies
            of any such websites.
        </p>

        <h2>What and How Information Is Collected</h2>

        <p>The personal information that we will collect about you falls into the following categories:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Information collected automatically by our website</strong> – our website collects some limited
                information about you automatically when you visit the site (for example, pages you click, IP addresses
                from which you accessed our website). We do not seek to identify you from this information or do
                anything with it that will affect you individually. Our website cookie notice provides more detail on
                the cookies that are used and how they impact the user experience.</li>
            <li><strong>Information that you input to our website</strong> – some pages on our website invite you to
                input information about yourself, for example when filling out our contact form. In those cases, the
                information sought is clear on the relevant page.</li>
            <li><strong>Information that you send to us by email or other electronic means</strong> – you may also send
                information about yourself by email or other electronic means (for example, through our Instagram). In
                that case we will record your name and basic contact details and, of course, the information that you
                include in your communication.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Purpose</h2>

        <p>We may use your personal information for the following purposes:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Performance of a contract</strong> – where we need to perform the contract we are about to enter
                into or have entered into with you</li>
            <li><strong>Legitimate interests</strong> – where it is necessary to conduct our business, including to
                manage and develop our business and, in particular, our relationship with you or the organisation you
                represent (if any)</li>
            <li><strong>To comply with our legal and regulatory obligations</strong> – we will identify that legal
                obligation where we rely on this legal basis</li>
            <li><strong>Consent</strong> – only where we have obtained your active agreement to use your personal
                information for a specific purpose, for example to subscribe to an email newsletter</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            We will only process your personal information as necessary so that we can pursue the purposes described
            above, and then only where we have concluded that our processing does not prejudice you or your privacy in a
            way that would override our legitimate interest in pursuing those purposes.
        </p>

        <h2>Information Distribution</h2>

        <p>We may disclose personal information about you, where reasonably necessary for the various purposes set out
            above:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>To employees, agents, contractors and other third parties or business partners as part of a formal
                engagement with you</li>
            <li>To your colleagues within the organisation that you represent (if applicable)</li>
            <li>To service providers who host the site or otherwise hold or process your information on our behalf</li>
            <li>In exceptional circumstances (for example, where we are required by law to disclose)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            We only store your personal information in the UK. Where we need to transfer your personal information to
            countries outside the UK, we always ensure that a similar degree of protection is afforded by ensuring that
            appropriate safeguards are implemented.
        </p>

        <h2>Retention and Deletion</h2>

        <p>
            We will only retain your personal information for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfil the purposes we
            collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or
            reporting requirements. We may retain your personal information for a longer period in the event of a
            complaint.
        </p>

        <h2>Security</h2>

        <p>
            We have appropriate security measures in place to prevent your personal information from being accidentally
            lost, used or accessed in any unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your
            personal information to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business
            need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions, and they are subject to a duty
            of confidentiality.
        </p>

        <h2>Your Rights</h2>

        <p>
            You may have a right of access to the personal information that we hold about you under data protection
            laws. You can also require any inaccurate personal information to be corrected or deleted. You can object to
            our use of your personal information for direct marketing purposes at any time and you may have the right to
            object to our processing of some or all of your personal information (and require deletion) in some
            circumstances. If you wish to exercise these rights, please contact us (see below).
        </p>

        <p>
            You can also lodge a complaint to the UK's Information Commissioner's Office (<a
                href="https://www.ico.org.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.ico.org.uk</a>). We would appreciate
            the chance to deal with your concerns in the first instance.
        </p>
